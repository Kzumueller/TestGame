Aimlessly wander through the maze yourself but beware of the Mighty Green Capsule! His primary job is to make sure that all of the golden spheres are still in place.  
He will, however, give chase if he sees you while he's on break.

Watch a bot moving towards one of the golden spheres, wander around aimlessly for a bit, and hunt down the next.  
By all means, hit 'Quit' as soon as you get bored.
